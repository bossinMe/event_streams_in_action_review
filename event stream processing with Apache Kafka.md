## Event stream processing with Apache Kafka

### Event stream processing

* Event stream processing can include backing up the stream, monitoring it, loading it into the database, or creating aggregates.
* Processing single events is much less complex than processing batches or windows of multiple events at a time.
* A common example of using the unified log, when processing a stream, the output of the stream processing is written back to the unified log usually under a different event stream.
